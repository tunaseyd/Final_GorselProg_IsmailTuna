# Final_GorselProg_IsmailTuna

I uploaded every important files other than packages from IDE itself...

In project you will be greated by Log_in form and you can login with username "Admin" and password "admin123"...

I added both MDIParent version and style from the Midterm, which is basicly non-MDI version, and both can operate effectively.

There was 3 requirement you especialy wanted from us, which are:
MDI => Done /
Effective Filters => Done /
Color Coding => NOT Done

Other things i fail:
Couldn't use "DEL" button as you would like to see, it does delete from dataGridView but doesn't change the DataBase.
Tried to get help from various sources but nothing worked.

I hope other things can satisfy you enough!
